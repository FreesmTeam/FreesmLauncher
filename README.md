- You can also install development builds.

### Development Builds

Please understand that these builds are not intended for most users. There may be bugs, and other instabilities. You have been warned.

There are development builds available through:

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/notwindstone/FreesmLauncher/actions) (includes builds from pull requests opened by contribuitors)
- [nightly.link](https://nightly.link/notwindstone/FreesmLauncher/workflows/trigger_builds/develop) (this will always point only to the latest version of develop)

These have debug information in the binaries, so their file sizes are relatively larger.

Prebuilt Development builds are provided for **Linux**, **Windows** and **macOS**.
