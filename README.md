### Development Builds

Please understand that these builds are not intended for most users. There may be bugs, and other instabilities. You have been warned.

There are development builds available through:

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/FreesmTeam/FreesmLauncher/actions) (includes builds from pull requests opened by contribuitors)
